# Engineering-Observation
For School Project, bascially a bunch of graphs and data
Well, these are some dumb measurements and data I got for my project...
I used matplotlib and pygal for the graphs, if you actually run my codes, they will return you a svg file and a png file, which manifests the interesting aspect of Python as a high-level language
